## Web Of Things using NodeJS!

**Some background on 'IoT'**

"The vision of a world where tiny computer structures
with sensors and communication interfaces are embedded
in the infrastructure  of cities, cars, offices..etc

**The Web of Things** is a specialization of IoT that
uses what made the web so sucessful and it applies it 
to embedded devices in order to make the latest developments
of IoT available to devs. 

## 1.1 Defining the Internet of Things

The vision of IoT is where the world is much 
more than the collection of multimedia content
: it extends into the physical, real-time-world
using small/tiny computers.

# Definition :

	The IoT is a system of physical objects that can be
	discovered, monitored, controlled, or interacted with
	by electronic devices that communicate over various
	networking interfaces and eventually can be connected
	to the wider internet.
	
A *smart thing* is a physical object that's digitally
autgemented with one or more of the following :

	* Sensors (temp, light, motion..etc)
	
	* Actuators (displays, sound, motors..etc)
	
	* Computation ( can run progs and logic )
	
	* Communcication interfaces (wired or wireless)
	
	Tags: NFC/RFID, QR 
	
	Devices: iBeacon/BLE, Arduino rPI
	
	Machines: Hue lights
